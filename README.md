Task:

The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter information about a student. The basic information about every student includes student type, first name, last name, gender, residency (in-state or out-state), number of credits taking, entrance date, home phone, mobile phone, and address (street, city, state, zip).

 

There are two types of students: bachelor and master. The program also records the advisor for a master student and whether a bachelor student is in the scholar program.

 

The program displays a short summary after each student has been entered. The summary includes, among others, registration fee, tuition (tuition rate * credits taking), and total fee (registration fee + tuition) of a student. The registration fee is $200 for in-state bachelor student, $600 for out-state bachelor student, $300 for in-state master student, and $900 for out-state master student. The tuition rate (per credit) is $350 for in-state bachelor student, $700 for out-state bachelor student, $450 for in-state master student, and $900 for out-state master student.

 

The program must use exception handling to maintain data integrity and must never crash. Name must consist of letters only. Gender must be ‘M’ or ‘F’. Number of credits must be between 1 and 21. Entrance date must be prior to today. State must be one of the 50 states of the US. Zip code must be a five-digit number. Phone numbers must contain ten digits.

 

The program must be written in an object-oriented style, using multiple classes and sub classes, applying encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
